              <p>Working alongside the university, we are actively striving to meet the housing needs of Cal Poly faculty and staff. Cal Poly Partners is currently developing new neighborhoods on and near campus that will offer for sale and rental housing. This new housing will complement our established Bella Montana faculty and staff community.</p>
